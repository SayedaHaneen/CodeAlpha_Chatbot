# Rule-Based Chatbot 

This is a basic text-based chatbot built using Python, created as part of my Code Alpha Internship.

 Features:
- Responds to greetings like "hello", "how are you", "bye"
- Case-insensitive input handling
- Expanded support for questions like "what can you do", "your name"
- Loop-based conversation with graceful exit on "bye"

 Technologies Used:
- Python (input/output)
- if-elif-else conditions
- Functions and loops

Sample Chat:
You: hello
Bot: Hi there! 

You: how are you
Bot: I'm doing great! How about you?

You: bye
Bot: Goodbye!
